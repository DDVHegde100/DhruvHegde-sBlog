      <h2>Behavioural Instincts of Teenagers</h2>

    		<br>
      <img src="./quantum.qoom.space_files/behave.png" style="border-radius:30px; height: 300px; width:370px;">
      <p>  </p>
      <p> As a current teenager, turning 14 around 2 weeks ago, there are countless ideas and thoughts that run in the mind of a Teen, despite most of them being irrelevent to innovation or benefitting the world, and more of them being put toward how they can beat the the Ender Dragon in Minecraft. There is general discrepancy among the thoughts and behavioural cues that are expressed by Teens, to which there are psychological facts. One common pattern I noticed among Teens and the conversations that they tend to have, myself included, is that the majority of their thinking goes into validation that they seek to get from their peers. Idealogically, the urge to be part of social convention and have a stroign status among others is a predominant concern that effects almost all Teens. There are several studies indicating the specific and somewhat odd behaviour Teens display as they reach adulthood. I have also noticed and explicitely drawn conversations, in order to support some of the distinct patterns I have noticed throughout middle school. <br>
      
       Throughout observations I have had with my friends and other acquantances, I thoroughly noticed that the upbringin of social status and acceptance is a constant struggle for many people. The plague that is social validation can vary across countless subjects, including clothing, style, intellect, sports, interests, hobbies, looks, and more. This behavioural struggle to be accepted from everyone around people is what boosts, but can also severely damage, your self-esteem and confidence. Being "important" in a social group is a what a lot of Teens aim for, as there is a constant battle to be the most popular or the "coolest" individual around. There is also research being done by Psychologists that indicate that Teens are persuaded to be in social situations where they are valued, more than other situations where they are treated as equals. This is also explained greatly by Dr.Fredric Neuman, who explains that their acceptance into a social group and their treatment within that space diectly influences their confidence and the happiness they feel from acceptance. I have also noticed that a considerable amount of conversations I have is mostly related to games or "relatable" topics. Dr. Mitch Prinstein throughouly explains the seek for validation as, "Scientific studies are now revealing that part of maturing affects how your brain responds to people around you, and right now it is kind of supercharged to care about your social relationships.". The standpoint of popularity, that is common throughout everyone, is a mantle or a position to which everyone is influenced by, and everyone wants to climb to that mantle, though it is a tough position, and a particularly useless one at that. Dr. Prinstein also expalins this quest for the principle position as, "Specifically, adolescent brains start to become really tuned in to who is getting the most attention, who seems most powerful, influential, and who everyone else wants to look at the most.", showing that regardless over your maturity or ignorence, it is rooted within Teens to want to be the "Alpha" male.
       <br>
    	   Regarding the "Alpha" male situation, there is also favorable research indicating that it can cause aggresive and somewhat competative behaviour between peers. According to research done by Neil Osterweil indicates that teenagers, during their gradual adulthood, get in conflicts with others of their gender, even their parents, to take over the "Alpha" Position and Dominance is a location. Dr David Elkand also discovered a conclusive pattern between a Teen's behavioour and their age, reconciling the amount of argyements and confrontations that they like to establish with their parents. I have also noticed that countless peers in my social group have a common beief that they are the center of atention, or that they are the supposed leader of the group, while it generally doesn't operate as such. I have also discerned that those who tend to associate hemselves with the leading position tend to repeat stuff and state things, that have already been established. While I can't provide a scientific explanation to that behavioural que, I infer that it is an attempt to associate themselves with the establishment of rules or "announcements", which could provide to display an influential role in the group. As previously mentioned, Dr. Fredric Neuman has perceived and pondered about social hierarchies-in locations such as the household or school-which tend to move from the immediate family and slowly regards colleages and friends. These social hierarchies generally influence your actions and association with social convention, and are predominantly controlling Teens.
    	   <br><br>
    			There are countless behavioural and psychological processes that occupy the mind of a Teenager, and there is many regards troward personal interest, yet the majority of the efforts goes into the expression of popular and general ideas in order to receive validation from their peers. I do infer that these changes are instinctive and have roots to early human psychology, which was key in being accepted and surviving. As a Teenager-thoguh I like to think that my efforts aren't directed into pointlessly pleasing others in order to feel acceptance-I can conslusively state that these are processes that run through the mind, at minimum, and continue to effect Teens, and others, throughout the world. In conclusion, the psychological and behavioural cues that Teenagers tend to display falls primarily in the attempt to be accepted and validated by their peers.

      <h2>How Healthcare is influenced by Technology</h2>

     <p>	</p>
     <p>
      		Technology has adapted and germinated over the previous decades, and as medicine also continues to stimulate, there is a great ordeal that can be acheived with the combination of 2 of the most omnipresent subjects in the world right now; with Technology being on the continuous rise and innumerable new vaccines and medicines being estbalished, especially for the COVID-19 Pandemic that is currently undergoing at this moment. In our contemproary socisty, there exists a paramount number of ailments and problems, that medicine is doing it best to prevent, but without the incorporation of Technology, the amelioration of medicinal products is limited. As a current Teenager-taking Health Class at school-I know the importance that Medicine has to our society and our individual health. The introduction of common vaccines and herd immunity have prevented increased global pandemics from occuring. With the combination of advanced Technology and Medicine, there can be many beneficial innovations regarding Healhcare.
      			<br>
      	     In our daiy lives, we are introduced to plastic materials and toys that are manufactured through 3d Printing, which also has primary implications upon the wordl of medicine. In the past few years, 3d printing has become popularized in medicine as bioprinting. using specific commands, bioprintuing can allow for synthetic organs to be easiy replicated and produced, in use for medical procedures. Biomedical componenets, commonlyu in the form of Bioink, canbe layeed to produce tissues andorganbs, and this is a revolutionary standpoint within Medicine. While organ donating is eminently risky and not always successful, bioprinting can allow for more dfiverse propostiotions, including the printing of specific organs, for children and aduls in need of it.There is even research being doen to print out ligaments and joints, which can have a significant impact for those with broken or weak limbs. With bioprinting, countless different cellular matrices can be synthesized normally, and can allow for individuals to be healed greatly and be restored to their former health, without much hassle. The printing and synthesis of complex 3d structure, from a machine, not only accounts for precision and execution, it can also adjust dimensions in order to match the individual in need for it, alloowing there to be a wider spectrum of options. 
      			<br><br>
      		Another primary reason as to the prominence of Technology in healthcare is due to Genomic sequencing, which is a contemporary field, but has the potenial to benefi anyone who has been suffering a drastic genetic disease, including sickle-cell disease or even cancer. While it is primarily used to identify the specific dissease and treatments that may directly attempt in immobilizing it, there are some solution that regard altering the genomic sequence of a particular individual. While the frequency of Genetic abnormalities is low, it can have a drastic and chronic impact upon an individual. Though the sequence only creates abnormalities every 100 million pairting, the severity of the reprecusssions due to this can easily be reversed using gene editing, after identifying the problem using gene sequencing. As a youthful individual residing in a sub-urban area currently, this could easily beocoem an omnipresent form of treatment in the next decade, which has the possibility to wipe out genetic disease consistantly. Using the technology of gene sequencing and editing, there are a multifarious amount of benefits that can be derived for healthcare globally.
      		<br><br>
      			Overall, there are many highlighted benefits from reconciling technology and healthcare, and introduces additional implications upon the entire field of anatomy. It can intrpoduce many pssibilities, both with various physical and chemical injuries. In conclusion, with the rising field of healthcare and technology, there will be even more innovations reagarding healthcare and it also has the potential to becopme more omniporesent and widespread, allowing for treatments for more serious injuries and ailments. That's why hgealthcare and technology go hand in hand and can provide a multitude of benefits to our contemporary society.

      <h2>Implimentations of Social Media Platforms on Teenage Psychology</h2>

      <p>  </p>
      <p>	As a Teenager, I have witnessesd the plague of Social Media creep over people and slowly start to wither their minds into a deep, dark abyss with no end. Social Media has been becoming increasingly popular, especially among Tech-Savvy Children, who have grown up with Technology at their side. Considering that he target demographic for this content is for Individuals above 13, I would gues that at least 80% of teens-in countries where Technology is readily avalible-have used some sort of Social Media. Research has been done over the past year to determine that almost 3.96 billion collective people have at least 1 form of Social Platform, albeit some are less harmful than others Giants in the particular Industry, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube(debatable), and more have established a foundation upon which innumerable Teesn spend all their time in order to seek Validation from starngers. While these social plaforms have given rise to some prominent individuals and creators, who otherwise would have gone unnoticed, it has a multitude of various negative applications in our society, and is an emerging problem considering the state of mental health. I have made some observations and collected some reliable sources of research, as to which I will present, in the aim to inform about the dangers of these Social Platforms. Social Media and Platforms have an eminent threat upon the Psychological being of Teenager and other Individuals.
    	<br>
    	<br>
    		Throughout the rise of Technology, Social Media has been an ever-present platform that is prominent to this day, drawing tens or hundreds of millions synchronous users a any point in time, as it is a global software. Throughout observations that I have made at Social gatherings and in groups, the preponderence of social media users is very common. There are bilions of users across all Social Plaforms, and if I were to infer, I would satte that it is based ona conclusive pattern, that after you go down the rabbit-hole of one socal platform, you are more likely to install others, to complete your user ecosystem. A statistical report done by Common Sense Media has shown that within a specific datan sample, almost 51% visit all their social plaforms on a daily basis and that around 25% of Teens are heavy social media users, spending hours sucked into a platform. Pew Research Center has also taken a study upon subject and has shown that throughout the rouchgly 95% of Teens that use Social Media, almost 71% use Facebook daily, 52% report using Instagram daily, and around 41% reported using Snapchat daily. These detrimental statistics display the omnipresence of their applications that aim to collect data and appear ot be a platform on which you can share your life experiences with your friends and family. 
    		<br>
    		<br>
    			Teens have expressed a particular interest in social platforms and continue to use it daily. The insabilities that can arise on social platforms are unporedictable, which make them a menace toward your emotional health. Another pertifying detail about social platforms are that they are managed by a corporation that collects data from it's users in order to sell your information-particularly your dislikes and likes, depending on the duration that you stay on a post-to other companies to advertise directly to you. Within the world of programming, almost anything is possible with sufficient knowledge of the subject. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram are specifically designed to retain the attention of an Individual for an extended duration by providing you with topics that match your interests, which causes the seperation from social platforms to be harder and more exhasting. Prominent studies from Harvard University have shown that when your interest is peaked on a social platform, your dopamine level rises greatly, within a short period of time. They also discerned the fact that the Nucleus Accumbens, a location in the brain responsible for reward and addictive activity, lights up and is stimulated within the presence of social media. This conclusively shows that Social media is adictive and you feel rewarded at the application, which causes the repeated use of the platform daily. King University has also done research on this, indicationg that the Ventral Tegmental Area(VTL) in your brain can be triggered from excessive use of social media. They also reported that the use of social media has direct implications upon decision-making and emotional connections. This is one preeminent danger that exists on all platforms, and is the reason I feel that these devloping applications should be regulated.
    			<br>
    			<br>
    				While the implications of social media reconciled with emotional function is more known, there are a lot of risks associated with Teenagers, which continues to worry me. While research does evidently demonstarte that the majority of Teenagers don't have an opinion on the effect, there are a lot who reported some detrimental effects from their use of social media. Forbes contributer Alice Walton has stated that with the use of these platforms, younger Individuals can feel more socially isolated, which can completely alter your emotional attachments. There are also countless Teens that have explicitely stated to Common Sense Media that their Mental Health was on the brink of collapsing during their use of social media. There are predominant conditions that canevelop and generate due to the duration of use, including severe anxiety, depression envy, sleep deprevation, and even lack of self-confidence. Thse effects are detrimental to one's psychological health and is mental torture for those who can't escape the grasp of social platforms. They spread quickly and decisively, without care, and aren't regulated through any filter, exposing you to a direct path into an addicitve state. As a Teenager, I stay away from social media and don't have any of the prominent social platforms, except YouTube, and I would advice you do so as well. The effects of social media are dark and have countless deletrious implications upon one's mental and psychological health.

      <h2>Detrimenal Implications of Homo Novus on our Planet</h2>

      <p>  </p>
      <p> In our contemporary society, Humans have a twisted perception, upon which they care about sustaining a functironing economy, rather than saving the planet. This philosopy burns throughout the roots of human history, as it burns through the world as well, killing entities that have observed as Humans destroyed the planet singlehandedly. While I am a human and also aspire to rise and reach economic stability and afford many pleasures, I realize the implications that countless individuals have brough upon our world. While not all individuals are corrupt, and there are innumerable people attempting in the reestablishment of a healthy world, there is a multifarious amount of people who simply don't care. As one who is growing up in one of the peak ages of Industrialization and growth, I have seen the applications of pollution and climate change. Humans have thrived and utilized this entire planet for ages and many period of time, where we have taken it's natural resources to get rich, but this is one misconception I feel the need to address. The philosphy that power comes from money may be partially true, but without morals or any conception of what one leaves behind, one is simply just an animal. Our spcies, Homo Novus, is a danger to all entities that inhibit the Earth and planet entirely, causing problems that couldn't even be conceptualized.
    <br><br>
    	  One very omnipresent pedicament, that has massive reprecussions throughout the world, is pollution. Pollution can be seen throughout the globe, and dwells at every corner in our filthy society. Almost 4.2 million of our own species die annually, due to the detrimental effects that it has to the environment. Chemicals and other substances are also thrown away into our fragile habitat, without much thought nor diligence as to the atrocities that may derive of that. The Biohazards arising from pollution itself are massive and with the almost 206 million pounds of toxic waste dumped into the ocean annually, we are both killing the planet and ourselves. I have seen a multitude of articles and news headlines stating the number of fish and other oceanic organisms found dead on a beach, due to their consumption of these chemicals and/or their involvement with pollution. With almost 100 million fish dying annually, the reprecussions are inordinately eminent, yet individuals refuse to accept the desimation that they have caused. Including the contemporary pollution aspects, such as microplastics, the predicament is massively hard to reverse, so many prominennt individuals just ignore it. The EPA has done countless studies and has approximated that an individual produces around 4.4 pounds of waste daily, ameliorating the rate at which Earth and it's inhabitants deterirate. The implications that are cuased due to pollution in oceans and on land are prominent, and the ramifications for this ameliorating factor is unthinkable.

      <h2>The Predomiant Importance of the Great Lakes</h2>
      <h5>By: Dhruv Hegde</h5>
      <h5>3/7/2021</h5>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo" aria-expanded="true">Click to Read!</button>

     <a href="https://quantum.qoom.space/##"><img src="./quantum.qoom.space_files/akes.jpg" width="400" height="300"></a>
     <p>	</p>
     <p>
      	As a current resident of Michigan, I have relaized the importance and signifcance tha thte Great Lakes provide for our society. They provide as a menaingful aspect of Nature, sourrounding the Entire state and providing to be a neccessity for millions of people. Throughout my life, and that of many of my peers, the Great lakes has been around and flourishing, but beneath the favorable expression, there are a lot of hidden predicaments. While they may not be evident equally in all the regions, they are discerned in almost all the parts and positions. Formerlly there have been incidents and perdiod that the lakes have had to endure, such as the heavy pollution in Lake Erie, almost 60 years ago, in the 1960s. It is an important responsibility-not only for those who live in Michigan, but rather the entire country- to keep the lakes regulated anmd healthy for future generations to be able to see it prosper in it's complete glory. The Great Lakes are a poredominant geograsphic entity that provide to be important to millions of people and can have detrimental effects on the economy, enviornment, and health if it isn't properly eradicated of toxins and harmful entities.
      	<br><br>
      		With the residencies in Michigan and the Northern Regions bordering the Great Lakes, there are almsot 33 million individuals that solely rely on the Great Lakes to provide them with an adequate amount of freshwater and resources. With the abundance of freshwaer in the Great Lakes, it constitues almost 84 percent of all the fresh water found in the United States, and even 21% of al the freshwater on the globe, making it one of the largst sources of freshwater in the entire world. Although this number is extravogan and immense, there are several difficulties that have risen in the Great Lakes, such as harmful Toxins and Chemicals. Although colectively the Great Lakes have almost 6.0 * 10^-5 gallons of water, it has been a prominent vicim to chemical waste and such Toxins. There have been over 362 different chemicals found in the great lakes so far, and throughout the years they have been harmind and continuing to effect much of the organisms in the water. There have been sopme speciifc chemicals identified for thewir drastic and calamitous implications in the Great Lakes. Accoridng to he US National Library of Medicine, some of these harmful chemnicals include mercury, dioxins, toxaphene, hexachlorabenzene, and others. The conversion from Mercury to the metylmercury can be immensly deletrious and cause profound effectsin organisms, branching from the structural entities to fish, which are then Toxic towards humaans. Putting aside the fact that fish are being harmed-which is a greatly minacious application itself-there is a lot of economic implications that may rise, due to the fcat that the fishing industry in the Great Lakes draws in almost 1.3 billion USD annually, which is a predominant amount for the state of Michigan and other sourrounding regions.
      		<br><br>
      			While there are an eminent number of programs and groups of Individuals, almost 140, attempting in the clean-up and restoration of the Great Lakes, the rate at which it is deteriorating is massive and may provide to be detrimenta towards the enitre country if an action isn't taken. there have been some provoking instances in the past, such as the fire lighting on the surface of Lake Erie, due to the copious amount of oils on the surface. As there is a multitude of chemicals and suibstances in the water, in some periods, they can react and inflict greater harm than they normally would. One instance of this is when there was a multitudunous amount of Industrial waste, which caused a combination of Phosphorus and Nitrogen. Due to the fertilizers and the pesticide run off from nearby agricultural facilities, these substances combines to provide as a catalyst for eutrophication, in which algae started to synthesize in immense amounts. The amount of chemicals and their combination with the water makes them inordinately complex to filter back the percipitate from the fresh water. With the copious amount of chemicals and other substances, there are more exmplaes of harm that come to the Great Lakes, majorly the Invasive species that have been introduced to the region. Some of these invasive species can be minacious to the other organisms,such as the lamprey. Organisms and Fishs resembling the Lamprey are eminent and can provide to be profoundly dangerous, as they destroy internals of fish and use them as a primary food source. Other species like the New Zealand Mud Snails don't cause direct harm. although their disruptions to the natural food chain and ingestion balance can be deadly. As I had once created a protype of a machine to eradicate this species, I can singlehandedly mention that they are reatively tough and only chemicals can be used in order to eradicate them completely. Thse organisms also pose a threat to the wildlife and the ecosystem that habituates thousands of various animals.

      			As there are a lot of omnipotent threats and concerns that sourround the internal strcuture of the great lakes, they have been meliorating throughout the years and it's intrinsic ecosystem is being restored.The Environmental Protection Agency in the US has beeen attempting in the restoration and regeneration of the Lakes and the overall entities that also inhibit the ecosystem. The Great Lakes are very important and have much impact upon our contemporary society. With the combination of forces, such as metropolitan citizens, tribal residents, EPA scientists, and general groups, restoration and rehabiitation can be possible. As the Great Lakes continue to perserve, Individuals must unite in order to save this prosporous geographic entity from facing complete death. The Great Lakes are eminent in our lives, and while the effects of toxins and chemicals are evident, it provides us with food, funds, water, and resources, and it is one of the most important geogrpahic landscapes to ever exist.

      <h2>Implications of returning to a systematic lifestyle during COVID-19</h2>

      <p>  </p>
      <p> Formerly, I have discerned many different applications of returning back to a systematic lifestyle, even though we are struggling to terminate a global pandemic. In my own community, there are numerous examples in which the school systems are opening once again and forcing students to return to school, even thought there are a multifarious amount of detrimental possibilities. Primary entities that used to be part of one's life are attempting to involve individuals in their system again, though I fear there are massive reprecussions that can be reconciled to their ignorence of chaos. The notion that one can seemingly adapt to another lifestyle after facing one of the greatest hardships in decades is somewhat comical, especially due to the fact that there are unaccounted facotrs that branch out from it simply being unsafe. Ignoring the ethical standpoint from which this decision was made, I do believe that the right intention was eminent, but with a somewhat loose execution. I believe that it is minacious to return back to our previous lifestyle and that it could be fatal to an innumerable amount of people.
    	 <br>
    	 <br>
    	In my community, the School Systems have been opened for around a month now and the reprecussions couldn't be more evident as of this moment. I am a currently a Middle School Student, and with my school being somewhat populated and also miniscule compared to the other schools in the area, the culminations of opening the school are being felt throughout. Approxiamately a week ago, there was menacing news about some individuals getting tested positive for COVID-19, and while it wasn't immedtely concerning, as more people started to ponder the implications, it had become severe. As of yesterday, a multitude of students reported that they have been inflicted with COVID-19, and while the number was below 10, the school took imediate action and started to quarantine hundreds of students who were within 6 feet of any of the students. Although the action that the School System implimented was impressive, it started to cause commotion and also disarray in the format of schooling. Our school is fairly small, with around 700 children, and of those 700, estimates report that almost 300, or 42%, of the school was put in qurantine, which caused much disorder in the format that the teachers depended on. As I am one of those who were quarantined, I am appreciative of the time that I can save by staying home and not wasting time at school, learning things at schools that I had known for several years previously, but there isn't any organized system in place for those who had to stay home. This is one of the primary reason as to which I think that it isn't the right time to return to a carefree system, as there aren't enough reserved propositions for emergencies. Returning to school can be fatal to some, and can easily spread throughout individuals in close contact. As I mentioned previously, less than 10 kids had conflicted the virus, but more than 40% of the school was qurantined due to the space in which we were enclosed in. Without a specific course of action, it seems rather rash to push students safety aside.
    	<br>
    	<br>
    		Another prominent reason I belive that we shouldn't continue our normal lifestyle is due to the fact that children weren't well prepared for the continuation of academic instruction, and especially the workload that comes alongside it. While I usually effciiently finish my homework and already know the information that school is attempting in teaching me, there are a lot of kids who are struggling, due to the lack of instruction and overall strcuture of the school. While I am planning on data I have collected for a seperate article, there is an application for it in this essay too, which clearly highlights the detriments of returning to school. After asking if students are stressed during school, almost 70% of the kids replied with either "Always" or "Sometimes", which goes to show that the majority are struggling. I can accomodate this fact as I have noticed that during our virtual endeavor, many students attended the zoom meeting, but weren't present and with the introduction of in-person school again, this sudden switch will disrupt their usual activities. Moreover, I have also noticed that there are a significant increase in the amount of tests and assesments that we are given. During the first semester, I noticed that there were only 1-2 assessments per class, while in this quarter alone, there have been at least 1-3 major assessments. That is a significant increase and with the amount of time that children had spent doing external activites during online, they have to dedicate a lot of time toward the preperation for tests or finishing of school work. The time that is deprived and the sudden disorder caused from the change in lifestyle can cause a lot of disarray in individuals and have detriemntal impacts upon them.
    			<br>
    			<br>
    				oOncluding this collection of thoughts, I can safely say that there are a lot of detrimental effects that can simply be reconciled to the returning to our previous lifestyle. While I do see this as causing disarray, the school system is trying it's best and abolsute hardest to make children comfortable and providing them with a place to socialize and interact with other indivuals and also reducing problems that students had with staying on electronics. Thank You for reading this, and I attempted to just speak my mind while writing this, rather than inform or persuade like my other essays. You may have also noticed the informal tone in this essay, and hopefully this essay will leave you to ponder the implications for yourself.

      <h2>Societal Ramifictions from the Automobile Industry</h2>

      <p>
      	Automobiles have been one of the most important technologies in our lives, chopping down transportation times and cost that would otherwise be substantial. While the automobile industry, along with companies in this space, seem to surge forward with their innovation and technology, more individuals are starting to question the morality of our dependence on these motor vehicles. Although it is a predomiantn part of one's life, it also accounts for around 20% of the global greenhouse gas emissions and costs countries a massive sum annually due to loss in fuel from cars in standby. While some countries don't feel the impact that this surge of vehicles in causing, it is still a global problem, growing at a scale that seems to be unpreventable. However, there are also multifarious companies trying to construct hybrids or powerful; electric cars that can accomplish the tasks of regular cars without leaving a major imprint upon our society. While Automobiles have been beneficial towards human interaction and economy, the system for these motor vehicles must be altered to sustain the Earth.  </p>
      <p> 
    	 <br>
    	 <br>
    	There are countless different car manufacturers globally, with some being more directed towards producing a product that is sustainible and friendly towards the environment, and others that are somewhat focused on environmental impact, but mostly on the benefits that they can provide to customers who purchase their product. Although several companies, such as Tesla, are pushing electric cars and more sustainible solutions, there is a price-premium to those vehicles, with many individuals and families not being able to readily purchase a Tesla car, especially with better options around. However, this isn't to say that the impact is negligible, as in previous years, hundreds of thousands of individuals have been paying a hefty fee to own a Tesla Vehicle, simultaneously helping sustain the environment. Addtionally, while it seems pointless for companies to join in the plenty of manufacturers who have gone eletric, they could actually see long-term profit yeilds, as the cost of production of parts would be lower, along with a larger market which they can occupy and take from other manufacturers. Addtionally, many tests have been done in the United States that clearly highlight that at least 25% of the population wishs for their next car to be electric and more consumers are being open to investing in an electric car, as the driving ranges and car specifications continuously get better. It is highly detrimental to the environement if more people continue to purchase fuel cars, which will inevitably cause need in the market for these energy-consuming hydrocarbon fuels. This shift to electric in the market may be detrimental to the economy during the peak of transfer, but can lower cost of production for the electric cars, driving the economy even higher than it previously was.
    	<br>
    	<br>
    	With the costs of production of the electric cars, it sems unwise for innovators to join this area, especially due to a company doing very well in this area. However, as more electric parts are produced and technology goes further, consumers may notice a downward trend in cost for electric cars, especially due to the renewable solutions paired with this car. While normal cars may be cheaper than Tesla Cars, their charging stations work very efficiently and only require a small fee, while other cars may require around 30-40 dollars everytime they fuel their car. The cost on superchargers may range from 8-10, which can be anywhere from 1/3 to 1/5 of the price per charge, which is particularly significant over time. Also, automobile giants such as Ford or GM may be losing on a big oppurtunity, as this market is new and not vastely occupied. Is Tesla and other electric companies continue their mission to produce electric cars, they can produce other ways of fueling their cars, such as solar roofs, which Tesla has already introduced. Generally, individuals have responded toi surveys asking about how long they've had their cars with over 10 years, averaging around 11 years from most sources. Innovations like the Solar Roof may be expensive, up to 10,000 to install a 5 kW one, but after around 6 to 7 years, the investment starts paying off, saving one thousands of dollars across the years, as they do not find it necessary to charge or get charge from a 3rd party location. Recyclked energy can also save around 65 billion USD annually, due to standby waste of fuel and also the net negative effects of emissions.
